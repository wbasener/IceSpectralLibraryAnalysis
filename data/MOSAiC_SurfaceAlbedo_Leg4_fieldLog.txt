Field log

June 13
"Ice station" ~ 30 nm from floe
14:26 UTC Ian began ASD albedo line on Port side of ship. Mostly overcast but with slightly changing conditions, not ideal for optics. Snow thickness and Snow Micro Pen (SMP) used along line. 5-m spacing
15:12 Laptop died after 100 m. Need to investigate battery life, which is better.
PS122-4_44_39 (ASD)

June 14 
Day 2 of "Ice station" ~ 30 nm from floe
11:20 UTC Began optics line on other side of melt pond on port side. ASD, followed by Ocean Optics, then quick surface characterization (photo & snow depth). Began quite clear, but then intermittent clouds moving over sun.. had to re-optimize frequently . (not ideal for optics) ~5-m spacing (Maddie on ASD)
11:55 ended line at 65 m due to time constraints. 
PS122-4_44_56 (ASD)

June 19
Day 1 on "Fortress" (MOSAiC CO)
11:56 UTC began first albedo line (name TBD: Lemon Drop line) on FYI, west side of floe, just south of old ship's location. Lots of proto-ponds, relatively thin snow/slush layer (~10 cm). Interesting surface expressions - appears to be melting depth hoar. Amy took a few microCT of these areas. 5 m spacing (Maddie on ASD)
12:38 ended first line. ASD 80-161
PS122-4_44_106 (ASD)

14:12 Began second albedo line (name TBD: Root Beer) on FYI, west side of floe, just north of old ship's location. Some thicker snow towards end of line between ridges; potentially some dirty/sediment-y snow towards start of line. 10 m spacing (Maddie on ASD)
14:35 ended second line ASD 162-203
PS122-4_44_107 (ASD)

June 20
12:11 Began ASD on 1st albedo line. Kipps followed slightly behind. Photos taken on Melinda's camera. Snow and water depth recorded along line. Maddie on ASD, Julia and Felix on Kipps. Kipps used similar to ASD, w/out tripod. Mostly CO-SDNV. 
Ponds slightly refrozen from the day before (~1 cm ice) with a very light dusting of fresh snow over everything. 
12:58 Ended ASD on 1st albedo line. Kipps finished just a few minutes behind. ASD 204-285
PS122-4_44_108 (ASD) PS122-4_44_110 (Kipps)

Melt ponds nearly fully frozen on surface, still some surface hoar and light snow (couple days old) on surfaces. Intended to begin GEM and Magnaprobe next to albedo line, but didn't happen due to connectivity issues with GEM. Line completed backwards (200-0 m) due to new road build from FYI coring to finish point. 
10:34 UTC Began transects. Sky BC.
11:26 UTC End transects 
ASD 534-618 (excluding: 538)
PS122-4_44_137 (Kipps) PS122-4_44_138 (ASD)

PS122/4_44-207 (ASD) PS122/4_44-210 (Kipps)

June 28
Morning: two Lidar scans (VZ6000) at optics area. 1 ~200 m on RB line, 2 between 0 on LD line and RB line. 

Repeat optics at ROV FYI site, because there was a fresh layer of snow overnight! (<1 cm). Should be interesting to compare with day before to understand effect of fresh snow event on melting surface. 
Sky: PC (not ideal for albedo, but mostly stable while measurements taken. ROV did transmittance measurements just prior at 0.5-m depth. Also took GPS coordinates of albedo stakes and Ilkka's ice markers (bamboo on surface) for collocation of obs. (gpx file)
13:20 UTC began ASD transect on ROV area. Maddie ASD (photos after). 
13:45 UTC Finished ROV transect. ASD 927-988, except 967-968

~11:30 UTC: under-ice L-Arm measurements at #19 (same location as albedo) with Guilia Castellani's L-arm setup. Snow thickness at Larm cores location: 5cm, 3cm,5cm. Point measurement coincident with albedo, and spaced along 180˚. 
~ 12:00 UTC: Optics core taken between points 19 & 20. Ice apparently similar to cores taken for chlorophyll at L-Arm location. 
PSS122/4_45-215 (coring - SI_corer_9cm)

June 30
Morning: bearguard for stakes reading (Ian & Julia). Took photos of potential optical tunnel sites near Reunion stakes, north of ADCP hole. Optical tunnels could be installed straight N of end of stakes line.

Afternoon: Albedo at optics lines. Maddie on ASD, Felix on Kipps, Debbie on notes/photos (field cam). Some of fresh snow from night of 27th still evident. 
12:17 UTC Lemon drop line. First ~50 m probably useless due to really strongly changing cloud conditions, then became clear. Some trampling on 200 position... 
13:04 UTC Finish LD line. ASD 1024-1105 (exclude 1106-1107)

July 1
(morning on ship)
Afternoon: test run of lead work at ROV lead area. Deployed castaway 9 times across lead, where 65 m wide. (every 5-10 m) Debbie took BGC/DMSP samples along transect and on paddle back. ROV did some diving around beginning of transect, with CT under the ice, and to near surface in lead (should compare!)
11:59 UTC: First GoPro video
12:29 UTC began profiling 
13:32 UTC end profile

July 2
Morning: Scout albedo library sites (for 24-hr ops) w Melinda
~10:30 UTC Installed 2 prototype 'optical tunnels' (45˚ angle, clear poly tubes) at 'Reunion stakes' - approximately level moderately ponded FYI, ~1.5 m thick. 1st under small pond (T01), 2nd under nearly uniform snow covered (T02). Not yet measured.
Afternoon: cancelled optics due to rain. On ship, prepping spectral evolution and rod for tunnel measurements.


July 3
Albedo work (morning: tunnels, afternoon: FYI albedo lines) cancelled all day due to rain. :(

July 4
Morning: reading stakes (Drone Bones & Reunion Stakes) w/ Ian. Noted long pillars of snow/ice grains near pond edges at reunion stakes, and melt holes (from rain?). 
Early afternoon: Optics at ROV area w/ ASD only (was supposed to do both over lunch, but miscommunication meant I wasn't able to get off ship). Maddie ASD, Amy notes and photos. 11:38 Start ASD transect
12:16 End ASD transect
Amy took CT samples at same locations as on June 28. 
Late afternoon: Lidar on Optics grid. Brought generator out to meet Ian after batteries died halfway through first scan (200 m on RBB line). Connectivity issues required using ipad to start scans rather than laptop, but settings were not quite right and 3 completed scans have poor returns. 

ASD 1191-1251 NOTE: 1191 file accidentally overwritten on July 5. (discard point - naned out in albedos csv)
PS122/4_45-135

July 5
Afternoon albedo transect cancelled due to rain
Afternoon: Set up snow on/off experiment in level area off stern of ship with Amy. 2 3x3m areas with 'gravel' snow grains. (STERN area, locations 1A and 1B)
12:50 UTC Took albedo of both before ('clean', then to-be-cleared), then shoveled one off completely. Note: Shoveled one had piece of pink flag in middle of area before shoveling...
13:20 UTC took albedo of both again ('clean', then cleared). 
ASD accidentally overwrote first file from July 4! (1191)
ASD 1251-1258
PS122/4_45-136 (ASD)

July 6
Morning: stakes installation (Ian, Maddie, Julia, Luisa) on SYI side of Met City ("the Bean Poles"). 9 stakes, most ~3 m (from 2.4-3.5 ish). On other side of Met City from Reunion states, with thicker & clearly sedimented ice. Ponds at a few stakes

July 10-11
24-hr sampling (Albedo!). 3 'locations': 
Reunion Stakes (RS) visited every ~3 hrs. (1) intersection of stakes 203&205, pond. (2) intersection of stakes 203&206, raised area of SSL. (3) intersection of stakes 203&207, sediment mounds (4) intersection of stakes 203&211, part raised SSL, some uneven surface
(5) stake 205 (6) stake 206, vertical grains & crack (7) stake 207, pond (8) stake 211, half uneven surface & level SSL
Stern (STERN) visited every ~3 hrs. (1) A - clean area from July 5, B - shoveled area from July 5, with ~1cm standing water. (2) pond, very holey bottom (3) other end of same pond, but smoother bottom. (4) Dark pond, measurement centered over large white (previously crack). (5) A - clean level bare (SSL) ice, on slope, and B - shoveled off to observe SSL evolution. (6) very blue pond (7) very large tooth-like grains (old drained pond?) at edge of pond 6
ROV transect, visited every ~6 hrs (with ROV transmittance & UAV albedo).

10:35 STERN PS122/4_46-113 Setting up sites. Amy took notes and photos. 5B not yet shoveled. 
11:04 ROV PS122/4_46-114 ROV optics transect & UAV albedo grid after
12:02 RS PS122/4_46-115. Took photos of sites with phone. 
13:13 STERN PS122/4_46-116. Tried to do some measurements from different angle, getting same location (BUT may not exactly match....) CO-SDV, foggy
16:08 RS PS122/4_46-117 CO-SDV, foggy
16:40 STERN PS122/4_46-118 CO-SDNV, foggy
17:25 ROV PS122/4_46-119 ROV optics transect right before; UAV albedo grid just after.
19:15 STERN PS122/4_46-120 Tried averaging 20 scans. Not clearly worth it, so switched back to 10. Some scans seem to not be good (didn't hold steady long enough?)
20:02 RS PS122/4_46-121 Amy took notes, photos, depths at sights. NIR, microCT, delta18 samples at 1 (A&B) and 5 (A&B)
22:00 RS PS122/4_46-122
22:18 STERN PS122/4_46-123
23:14 ROV PS122/4_46-125. CO-SDNV, visibility improving. ROV & UAV optics surveys after. 

July 11
01:22 STERN PS122/4_46-126. Ian did measurements, Melinda notes. In wrong order (& missed 7) Some seem to not be in exactly the same location. ASD 1958-1973
01:58 RS PS122/4_46-127. Ian did measurements, Melinda notes. Some seem to not be in exactly the same location. Battery died after position 5. ASD 1974-1983
04:07 RS PS122/4_46-128 CO-SDNV, good visibility, drizzly
04:27 STERN PS122/4_46-129 CO-SDNV, good visibility, drizzly
05:07 ROV PS122/4_46-130 Rain starting. Paused at 40 m, stopped at 100 m due to rain. No UAV flight due to rain. ROV optic transect ~during rain break. ..
07:20 STERN PS122/4_46-131 CO-SDNV, good visibility, not raining! windy. 
08:06 RS PS122/4_46-132 CO-SDNV, good visibility, not raining! windy. Amy took photos, samples (NIR images, delta18, microCT at 2+5)
10:12 RS PS122/4_46-133
10:31 STERN PS122/4_46-134
10:58 ROV PS122/4_46-136 ROV did optics transect sometime during measurements. No UAV. 

Lessons learned: (1) pick very uniform sites so exact aim of sensor is not so important. (2) preferably same person does all measurements to ensure consistency. (3) not necessary to average more than 10 scans. 

July 12
No science on ice. Ship had to reposition as a result of motion from ice pressure overnight.

11:50 UTC: ASD measurements at same points measured previously (1A&1B, then 2&3 from stern area), as well as 2 more over more bubbly/white areas. Pond now quite close to stern of ship. Felix's ocean optics in same locations. ECO & BGC water sampling, then Magnaprobe survey of pond - avoiding areas of samples (2&3). Cores collected from near point 2 - salinity & nutrients, methox, DIC, chlorophyll, Optics, microCT (top porous part, bottom puck)... optics core collected underneath where L-Arm measurements were taken. 
False bottom present. ASD 2642-2651

Evening: measurements of 2 optical tunnels @ Reunion Stakes w/ Lianna
17:41 UTC Begin measurements of tunnel 1 (under bare ice). Some condensation inside of tube. Medium sized melt well around tunnel. 
Scans 1-9. 
17:59 UTC Begin measurements of tunnel 2 (in melt pond). Large melt well around tunnel. Removed ablation shield after measurements. Challenging to decide where 'ice' begins... measured ice surface level with tube at ~70cm, but tunnel actually under ice beginning ~40 cm. 
Scans 10-17. 
Took photos of tunnels.
